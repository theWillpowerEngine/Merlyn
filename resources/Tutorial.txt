Everything from the old coded-out example has been moved over to the guide already.




console app built-ins (includes compiled):

	cls / input
	
  examples:

	(print (str 'hello ' (do (pnb 'Enter your name: ') (input))))



	(do 
		(sod o (enclose {_p: 1} {getP: (=> (this._p)), incP: (=> (.sod this _p (+ this._p 1)))}))
		(print o.getP)
		(o.incP)
		(print o.getP)
		(o.incP)
		(print o.getP))
