This file is now for anything that might be relevant to the written guide that I haven't written in it yet.

Everything from the old coded-out example has been moved over to the guide already.




console app built-ins (includes compiled):

	cls / input
	
  examples:

	(print (str 'hello ' (do (pnb 'Enter your name: ') (input))))



TODO

	pub/sub		-	Awaited things pub, awaiting things sub
	raise		-	"push" something into an Awaiting list.  Not sure exactly how this works yet.
