This file is now for anything that might be relevant to the written guide that I haven't written in it yet.

Everything from the old coded-out example has been moved over to the guide already.




console app built-ins (includes compiled):

	cls / input
	
  examples:

	(print (str 'hello ' (do (pnb 'Enter your name: ') (input))))



	(do 
		(sod o (enclose {_p: 1} {getP: (=> (this._p)), incP: (=> (.sod this _p (+ this._p 1)))}))
		(print o.getP)
		(o.incP)
		(print o.getP)
		(o.incP)
		(print o.getP))


	; The snippets just keep becoming cooler, lol
	(do
		(await res (do 
			(sub "Dan" (try ()->(sendAll `The Admin says: {$val}`) ()))
			(telnet 4676 
				(if (= $input "quit") 
					(do (print "quitting")(stop "Quit as instructed"))
					(print $input)))))
    
		(while (awaiting? res) (pub "Dan" (input)))
    
		(print `Finished with {$res}`))



TODO
