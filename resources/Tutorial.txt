	Add a bugfix test for the duplicating-queues-of-doom bug:
		(do
			(cls)
			(defn make-command (cmd val) (pair "cmd" $cmd))
			(awaith res (do 
				(sub "Command" (switch (lower val.cmd)
					"quit" (do (print "quitting") (sod done true))
					"hello" (print "Hello Nurse")
					(throw `Unknown command: {val}`)
				))
				(sod done false)
				(while (! $done) (nop))))
 
			(while (! (queue? "Command")) (nop))
			(pub "Command" (make-command "Hello" ()))
			(print (awaiting? res))     ;True
			(pub "Command" (make-command "quit" ()))
			(print `Final result was {$res}`)
		)
        


TODO

	Add CTOR (Implementer-named function)
	new keyword
	atom keyword (prevent interpreter from evaluation-slicing)

	shIDE is sometimes weird with the working directory (seems mostly in debug mode, but figure out a final solution)
